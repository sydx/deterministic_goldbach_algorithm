# deterministic_goldbach_algorithm

A deterministic algorithm for finding Goldbach pairs for all even numbers greater than 2.

In my earlier preprint, "A Constructive Proof of the Goldbach Conjecture via Imbalance Trails and OEIS Sequence A026741", https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5340171, I derive a deterministic algorithm for finding Goldbach pairs for all even numbers greater than 2.

This source repository contains an implementation of this algorithm.
